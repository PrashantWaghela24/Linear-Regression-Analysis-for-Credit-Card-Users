# Linear-Regression-Analysis-for-Credit-Card-Users
The project provides a detailed methodology to implement Multilinear regression which analyses a linear variable credit card debt based on the data of credit card users. The entire process is divided into 3 sections namely, analysing the descriptive statistics and their visualisations, transforming the data, and eventually applying various regression models for comparison purposes. Furthermore, different intermediate regression models are rejected based on Gauss Markov and other multilinear regression assumptions to achieve an acceptable model which satisfies all the parameters.
Steps Used Before Model Building: Scatter Plot Analysis, Histogram Plots, Box-Plots, Removal of Outliers
Tests Used to Validate Models: Non-Constant Variance Test, Variance Inflation Factor Test, Durbin Watson Test, Normal Q-Q Plot Test, Cook's Distance Plot
