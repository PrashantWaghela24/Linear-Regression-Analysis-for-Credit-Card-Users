# Linear-Regression-Analysis-for-Cridit-Card-Users
The project provides a detailed methodology to implement Multilinear regression which analyses a linear variable credit card debt based on the data of credit card users. The entire process is divided into 3 sections namely, analysing the descriptive statistics and their visualisations, transforming the data, and eventually applying various regression models for comparison purposes.
